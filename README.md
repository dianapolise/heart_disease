# *Heart Disease*

# ***Neural Network for Breast Cancer Prediction***

This project implements a feedforward *Neural Network* with four layers, comprising a total of 35 neurons, alongside a Logistic Regression model utilizing *Scikit-Learn* to predict breast cancer. Leveraging a built-in dataset, the models achieve a prediction accuracy of approximately 85–88% on both training and test sets, showcasing their reliable performance in binary classification tasks.

***Features***

Binary Classification: Implements a neural network for distinguishing between two categories (e.g., benign and malignant).

Data Preprocessing: Handles and preprocesses data efficiently using pandas.

Data Visualization: Explores relationships and correlations in the dataset with seaborn.

***Installation***

To run this project, you’ll need:

- Python 3.12

- Libraries: numpy, pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn, tensorflow

**Install the required dependencies using pip:**

| *pip install numpy pandas seaborn scikit-learn tensorflow* |
|-----------------------------|

***Usage***

Clone this repository or download the notebook.

Open the provided Jupyter Notebook.

The built-in dataset is loaded and processed automatically within the notebook.

Run the notebook to:

- Train the model.

- Evaluate its performance.

- Visualize the results.

Outputs include metrics such as prediction accuracy (~98%) and insights from visualized relationships in the data.

## Dataset

This project utilizes the [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/heart-failure-prediction) provided by **Federico Soriano** on Kaggle. The dataset contains labeled information to predict heart failure events based on a variety of features.

This dataset was created by combining different datasets already available independently but not combined before. In this dataset, 5 heart datasets are combined over 11 common features which makes it the largest heart disease dataset available so far for research purposes. The five datasets used for its curation are:

- Cleveland: 303 observations
- Hungarian: 294 observations
- Switzerland: 123 observations
- Long Beach VA: 200 observations
- Stalog (Heart) Data Set: 270 observations
